## ⚙️ Technical Implementation Details

### **AI State Management**
```javascript
aiState = {
    mode: 'fire',                    // Current AI mode
    emergencyActive: true,           // Emergency status
    victimDetails: {                 // Victim information
        name: "Priya",
        age: 28,
        medicalConditions: ["asthma"],
        location: {...}
    },
    emergencyId: "FIRE_001",         // Emergency case ID
    conversationContext: [...]       // Recent conversation history
}
```

### **Event System**
```javascript
// Emergency triggered
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('emergencyTriggered', {
    detail: { type: 'fire', victim: {...}, communityId: 'fire_emergency' }
}));

// Emergency accepted
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('emergencyAccepted', {
    detail: { emergencyId: 'FIRE_001', responder: {...}, eta: '5 min' }
}));

// Emergency resolved
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('emergencyResolved', {
    detail: { emergencyId: 'FIRE_001', emergencyType: 'fire' }
}));
```

### **Chat Integration**
```javascript
// AI messages injected like normal chat messages
const aiMessage = {
    id: `ai_${Date.now()}`,
    user: { id: 'ai_assistant', name: '🤖 Emergency AI', avatar: '🤖' },
    message: "AI response here...",
    timestamp: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
    communityId: currentCommunityId,
    type: 'ai_response'
};

app.addMessageToChat(aiMessage);
